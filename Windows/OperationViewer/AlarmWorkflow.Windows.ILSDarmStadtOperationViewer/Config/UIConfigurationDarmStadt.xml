  <!-- Defines the display names of the vehicles.
        
       "MustContainAbbreviations" contains a comma-separated list of all abbreviations that must be contained in order to accept this vehicle.
                                  This is helpful with huge lists of requested vehicles where not only our vehicles get requested, but ones
                                  from other cities as well. If this list is empty, then any vehicle (configured below) will be shown.
    
       "Identifier" is the text that is read from the fax
       "Name" is the text that is displayed in the UI
       "Image" is the path to the image/icon that is displayed for this vehicle (relative to the Application-directory)
